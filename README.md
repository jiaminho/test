# COVID-19 Drug Design using Generative RNN-LSTM

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), a type of virus known to cause respiratory infections in humans. This new strain was unknown before December 2019, when an outbreak of a pneumonia of unidentified cause emerged in Wuhan, China. The first case of COVID-19 in Malaysia was detected on 24 January 2020. 

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) results show close homology to the bat Coronavirus. A crystal structure of the main protease of the virus was obtained by Liu et al., found at https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7

Since the outbreak, researchers have been collaborating and working closely to stop the spread of the disease and to propose possible treatment plans. New advances in machine intelligence have introduced algorithms that can learn important patterns from vast amounts of data, approaching expert-level of ability in some tasks. This means that anyone with these models can contribute to the global research effort. 

My project uses many ideas and implementations developed by others, and bring them together towards a common task. My main reference was [Topazape's](https://github.com/topazape/LSTM_Chem) repo which implements the paper [Generative Recurrent Networks for De Novo Drug Design](https://doi.org/10.1002/minf.201700111). 

The aim of this project is to find drug candidates (ligand) with a high binding affinity with the COVID-19 main protease using deep learning.

1. Outline of the problem and introduction

2. Dataset preparation

3. Train LSTM-based RNN model

4. Generate SMILES strings

5. Use transfer learning to fine-tune model, generating molecules that are structurally similar to potential protease inhibitors of COVID-19

6. Use PyRx to get binding scores of molecules with SARS-CoV-2 main protease

7. Highest scoring candidates are reported


## Requirements

This model is built using Python 3.7, and utilizes the following packages;

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- tqdm
- Bunch
- matplotlib 
- RDKit 
- scikit-learn

## Dataset Preparation

I combined datasets from two sources: i) [Moses data set](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses) and ii) [ChEMBL data set](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). Together these two data sets represent about 2.5 million smiles.

Preprocess dataset to remove duplicates, salts, stereochemical information, nucleic acids and long peptides. https://github.com/topazape/LSTM_Chem

In anaconda prompt, cd to the file and run python cleanup_smiles.py datasets/all_smiles.txt datasets/all_smiles_clean.txt

After cleaning the smiles using the cleanup_smiles.py script and only retaining smiles between 34 to 128 characters in length, './datasets/all_smiles_clean.txt' contains the final list of 180793 smiles on which the model was trained.


#### Potential COVID-19 protease inhibitors were included for model fine-tuning using transfer learning

According to this paper - [Binding site analysis of potential protease inhibitors of COVID-19 using AutoDock](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13337-020-00585-z)
